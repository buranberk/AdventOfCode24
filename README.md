# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions in Rust ðŸŽ„ðŸ¦€

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions written in rust for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual programming challenge where everyone solves daily coding puzzles.

## Repository Structure
```
advent-of-code/
â”œâ”€â”€ day1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ day2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager, comes with Rust installation)

## Running Solutions

### Navigate and Run
To run a specific day's solution, navigate to its directory and use Cargo:

```bash
# Example for Day 1
cd day1
cargo run

# or run with release optimizations
cargo run -r
```

## Approach and Notes
- Each day's solution is in its own self-contained Rust project
- Focusing on clean, idiomatic Rust implementations
- Learning and exploring algorithmic solutions

## Learning Resources
- [Advent of Code Official Website](https://adventofcode.com/)
- [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)


Happy Coding! ðŸš€
